# Maze Game

Server was deployed on heroku.
This is an online multiplayer maze game where you race against your opponent(s). Very interactive and enjoyable. 

When you reach the end of the maze, a new maze is generated.
There's also a chat feature where multiple people can (trash) talk to each other.

Took around 2 weeks to finish, made on Repl.it. Made mainly with Javascript and CSS, and a small amount of HTML.
